After weeks of late nights in the robotics lab, countless design iterations, and a few close calls with the 3D printer, we're thrilled to officially reveal our 2025-2026 competition robot: **Phoenix**.

## Why Phoenix?

The name Phoenix represents our team's spirit this season. Like the mythical bird rising from the ashes, our robot embodies our approach to the engineering design process - constantly iterating, learning from failures, and emerging stronger each time.

## Key Features

### Mecanum Drivetrain
Phoenix features a powerful mecanum drivetrain that gives us omnidirectional movement on the field. This allows our driver, Ryan, to navigate tight spaces and position the robot precisely for scoring.

- 4 REV HD Hex Motors
- Custom 3D-printed motor mounts
- 12:1 gear ratio for optimal balance of speed and torque

### Dual-Stage Lift
Our lift mechanism extends to reach the highest scoring positions while maintaining stability:

- Linear slide system with bearing support
- Two-stage extension reaching 36 inches
- Encoder-based position control

### Active Intake
The intake system was designed by Marcus and the build team to quickly collect game elements:

- Compliant wheel design for secure grip
- Adjustable tension system
- Sensor-triggered automatic grabbing

## Autonomous Capabilities

Sofia and the programming team have been working on our autonomous routines. Phoenix can currently:

1. Navigate from any starting position to the scoring area
2. Score preloaded elements with 95% accuracy
3. Return to parking position before time expires

We're still fine-tuning the computer vision system to detect and collect additional game elements during auto.

## What's Next

With League Meet 1 just around the corner, we're focusing on:

- Driver practice sessions
- Fine-tuning PID constants
- Adding redundancy to critical systems
- Preparing our pit display

Stay tuned for updates from our first competition!
