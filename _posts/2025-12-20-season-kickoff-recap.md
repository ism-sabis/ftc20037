The moment we've been waiting for is finally here! Last Saturday, we gathered in the school cafeteria to watch the official game reveal for the 2025-2026 FTC season: **INTO THE DEEP**.

## Game Overview

This year's game challenges teams to score game elements in various underwater-themed zones. Here are the key game objectives:

### Autonomous Period (30 seconds)
- Start from designated positions on the field
- Navigate to collection zones
- Score in high and low goals
- Park in the observation zone

### Driver-Controlled Period (2 minutes)
- Collect game elements from the field
- Score in tiered goals (higher = more points)
- Defend strategic positions
- Endgame climbing challenge

## Our Initial Strategy Analysis

After the reveal, we broke into subteams to analyze different aspects of the game.

### Build Team Analysis
Marcus led the build team in identifying key mechanisms we'll need:

1. **Drivetrain Requirements**
   - Need for precise positioning (favors mecanum or swerve)
   - Must handle the field obstacles
   - Speed vs. pushing power tradeoffs

2. **Scoring Mechanisms**
   - Reach height needed: 24-36 inches
   - Multiple scoring positions require flexibility
   - Speed of cycling will be crucial

3. **Intake Design**
   - Game element geometry and weight
   - Collection from floor vs. human player station
   - Holding capacity considerations

### Programming Team Analysis
Sofia's programming team focused on autonomous potential:

- "The autonomous period is worth a significant portion of points this year"
- Computer vision will be essential for detecting game elements
- Path planning needs to handle obstacle avoidance

### Strategy Team Analysis
Anya and the drive team looked at match strategy:

- Alliance coordination will be key
- Defending high-value scoring positions
- Endgame timing decisions (climb early vs. score more)

## Next Steps

Based on our analysis, here's our roadmap for the next few weeks:

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Week 1 | Drivetrain prototype and testing |
| Week 2 | Intake mechanism prototypes |
| Week 3 | Lift/scoring mechanism development |
| Week 4 | Integration and software development |
| Week 5 | Driver practice and autonomous tuning |

## Prototype Palooza

This weekend we're hosting our annual "Prototype Palooza" - a full-day workshop where we'll build and test multiple mechanism concepts. Each subteam will create at least two different prototype approaches, and we'll evaluate them based on:

- Reliability
- Speed
- Ease of manufacturing
- Maintenance requirements

## Join the Discussion

We're posting regular updates on our Discord server. If you're a team member and haven't joined yet, ask a lead for the invite link.

For other teams: we believe in the FIRST principle of Coopertition. If you want to discuss strategy or share ideas, reach out! We're always happy to help rookie teams get started.
